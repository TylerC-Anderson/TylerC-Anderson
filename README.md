# 👋 Hi, I’m Tyler (@TylerC-Anderson)

🧙‍♂️ Welcome to the digital equivalent of my wizard's tower! 🧙‍♂️

Here you'll find my lab notebook for ongoing experiments, and hopefully a few completed projects.

If something here helps you, sparks an idea, or even drives you a little crazy then please reach out! I love talking shop about ethical hacking and self-hosting.

### 📜 Summary

👀 **Focus:** Ethical Hacking, Cybersecurity, and Networking  
🎯 **Goal:** Red Team Engineer (currently pursuing *PJPT* → *PNPT* → *CPTS* → *OSCP*)  
🌱 **Currently Learning:** *PJPT*, HackTheBox labs towards _CJCA_<br>
🚀 **Next Steps:** Listed because they are many 😅
 - Start my cybersecurity blog - security-related thoughts, experiences, and detailed walkthroughs from my journey
 - Learn `vim`
 - Learn Rust 🦀 or Zigg ⚡
 - Practice Functional Programming
🤝 **Open To:** Collaborating on cybersecurity tooling, networking experiments, AI security, or any project with a security twist

### 🛠️ Current Works-in-Progress

- 🧭 **Certification Sprint (Fall 2025– Fall 2026):** Completing a self-directed, year-long path toward the latest generation of ethical hacking certifications. In order I will get: **PJPT (TCM-Sec) → PNPT (TCM-Sec) → CPTS (HTB)**.
    - I prefer the latest generation of certs, because they are focused on hands-on labs, industry-standard penetration testing methodology and reporting, and real-world red team workflows. 
    - As practice, and hopefully to tie up another certification under my belt, I'm also working through the **CJCA** path in HackTheBox, and will grab that cert if I have time.

- 🧩 **Offensive Security Notes Upload:** Gradually redacting and uploading my notes for certification prep, OverTheWire wargames, and other training boxes.
    - These walkthroughs serve as both study references and public documentation of methodology.
    - The aim is to provide a record of how I work, how I think, how I learn, and the technical depth I’ve built through hands-on practice.

- 🎓 **M.S. Computer Science (Cybersecurity Focus)** — Arizona State University  
  *Paused for Cert Sprint - Bridge courses in progress - 4.0 GPA to date.*

- 🧰 **Home Server Project** — Running Ubuntu with Dockerized services for media streaming, web hosting, and backups via Cloudflare reverse proxy  
  *(99% uptime, remote available behind reverse proxy, serving Jellyfin + NAS storage)*

### 🧩 Completed Projects & Hands-On Security Practice

- **Wargames:** Completed *OverTheWire Bandit* & *Leviathan*, progressing through *Natas* (privilege escalation, scripting, web exploitation)
- **Custom Tools:**
    - PyScan - a DIY port scanner in Python that is like nmap's extremely less capable cousin, but it works!
    - various scripts for my day job - cannot include here due to legal stuffs
- **Homelab**
    - Configured secure DNS sinkhole (PiHole)
    - Pwnagotchi - Cannibalized from that PiHole; my lil' hacking buddy that eats salted wifi passwords (handshakes). Good for helping me to get out and take walks.
        - Her name is `Haribo`
            - Yes like the candy 🍬
    - Riced linux desktop, a Dual-boot system running Sway.
        - Yes, I do use *Arch, btw*
        - Set up:
            - `snapper` system snapshots
            - workflow tooling
            - full disk encryption
        - Had to fix:
            - converted from ext4 to BTRFS (so `snapper` would work)
            - remapped encrypted disks after UUID changes
