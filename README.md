 👋 Hi, I’m Tyler (@TylerC-Anderson)<br>
Nice to meetcha! Welcome to my blog/portfolio/project repo/technical journal. Following are some sections about my journey into the wide world of technology. Everything contained here and elsewhere on my git are all works in progress and thus are subject to edits, thoughts, and revisions. Please reach out to chat or let me know if there was anything you liked, or that drove you crazy.

In summary:<br>
👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity and Networking<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning Networking (A+ and Net+), Linux, Python, and CtFs.<br>
🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on programming, learning Cybersecurity, Networking, or any project of yours that's interesting you think I would make a good contribution to!

What I'm currently working on:

✏️ Education:<br>

✏️ BS Degree: Computer Science | Southern New Hampshire University

⛏️ Physical Project:   Dual boot windows/linux on home PC, issues with shutdown. Hangs with an error regarding SystemMD unable to shutdown networking related processes. Shutdown via power button turns machine off, and seems to have no ill effects, but is annoying.

⛏️ The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles (AKA NaND2Tetris) | Book

Completed Projects!<br>
 PiHole Personal DNS Sinkhole:<br>
   Status: Being used daily! Pi is currently working as DNS sinkhole, now will allow it to make requests to authoritative DNS servers. Will no longer use other DNS servers. This should improve privacy and make certain attacks, such as DNS poisoning, more difficult.

Project Ideas:
Home Hosting - Would like to make a home server running plex for streaming, as well as any other home-hostable service I can think of. Could run as a VM on a cloud machine I subscribe to, but would mostly like to build my own box and run it from home. Owning the machine and running from home ould assist with latency and downtime would be fixable locally. Could also move the DNS sinkhole to this machine as well. Could maybe even set up a virtual machine on it and use it as a hackable box to train pentesting on. Finally could also use this machine whenever I play a game that requires a server to be run from home in order for multiplayer to work.

Work automated emailing - My position requires numerous emails to be sent out each day and the emails are autoformatted and sent with the same attachments each time based off relatively simple criteria. Would be nice to find some way to have a script look at my schedule for the day, check the statuses of each contact, and send out the appropriate emails and attachments at the click of a button.

What I've actually done:<br>

Personal projects:<br>
✔️ Built, troubleshot, maintained my own custom desktop PC. I have upgraded the case, storage, memory, cooling, mobo, CPU, and expansion cards multiple times.<br>
✔️ Upgraded, repaired, and reinstalled OSs<br>
✔️ Set up multiple VMs<br>
✔️ Set up a packet sniffer<br>
✔️ Coded a web crawler in python<br>
✔️ Set up a DNS Sinkhole using a raspberry pi.<br>
✔️ Set up a home network with multiple devices<br>
✔️ Coded numerous quick scripts, both for school and for work productivity<br>

For Others:<br>
✔️ Worked in professional settings with both Mac and PC (Personal computer and current FT position is Windows, lab environments are in Linux)<br>
✔️ Troubleshot issues for self, coworkers, friends, and family<br>
✔️ Set up Google inboxing rules and advised on backup solutions in my consulting role. Also investigating tool creation for functions my client's needs.<br>

 🖖 A bit more about me - <br>
I'm diving headlong into the world of tech, specifically Cybersecurity and Networking. I have a wide range of skills from my time in retail to my experience as a biology research assistant and now my current position as an IT Technical Support Representative. I am a quick study, I love to learn, and I have excellent communication skills from my time in customer service. These qualities and more make me a great asset to any team. When I'm not studying for certs or keeping up to date with the latest tech-related news, I'm likely tinkering on my Linux VM, hanging with my partner and our cat, playing tabletop games or videogames with my friends, or watching something nerdy on TV.
